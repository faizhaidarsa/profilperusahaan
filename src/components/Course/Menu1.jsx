              format. The workshop provides training materials and examinations
              to determine the weaknesses of the student and one-on-one tuition
              from our Level III instructor to develop those weak areas.

              manual for each student. The manual includes daily quizzes that
              are reviewed by the instructor and are intended to provide an
              indication of progress to both the student and the instructor.
